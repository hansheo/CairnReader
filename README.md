# CairnReader

Hello ! This is a small program that I made for a college assignment during my research. It's clumsy, very simple, but it works. 
It parses the French speaking platform Cairn.org to get elementary stats on publishers and articles. You will have to do the bulk of the work on R if you want to go deep into it, but its a start ! Feel free to use it and improve it as you can. It was made thanks to the initial teaching and help of Stéphane Lamassé and the PIREH team of Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne, so if you are French student and want to learn more about this kind of programs in the context of your research, you should go to them to learn about the teaching modalities.
In any case, feel free to ask !
